## Why do you want to work for Abstraction?

I found abstraction.games just couple of days ago but I'm really impressed with the amount and quality of the work. 
The team is surely very skilled, 50+ titles speaks for itself. Looking at pictures, they are all very nice pople.
The people in the company are very important to me, and a good communication is a key. 
The amount of title is appealing to me, because of many skilled collegues I can learn from. Also I'll be happy to share my knowledge.
Personal/Proffesional growth is essentail to me and I'm always looking for a unexplored teritory and new challenges.

And definitely, to have a nice drawn portrait will be super cool :D

## Based on the technical spec, which areas to you consider your core strengths?

Looking at job positions, I find myself between engine and lead programmer.

Working with UE4, I use to talk about two types of programmers.

1. Gameplay programmers, using C++ as a de-facto `scripting` language, creating gameplay code and UI and creating blueprints. Usually you have some tutorial on your problem on the web.
2. Core/Engine programmers, using C++ on deeper level. Usually, you are not able to find a tutorial on the web, and you are on your own, you need to explore. Creating tools and plugins to improve productivity, integrating 3rd party plugins, optimizing code, rewrite blueprints and participate on more low implementations.

I'm comfortable with the both ways, but I like the 2nd the most. 

I can see abstraction.games is professional company, with many amazing programmers of type 1. 
Also, I bet many of the following ideas are already implemented or waiting in the pipeline.

Anyways, I can imagine, we can create a new plugin to sell on marketplace and help developers to boost their productivity.
We can identify and extract some functionality you are using from project to project and make reusable tool saving your time. 
What about CI/CL? What about company coding standards? You can name it, the posibilites are almost endless.

To name a few core strengths:

- I'm able to work with large code bases
- I understand game development process and I've big picture in my mind
- I know how to create tools and plugins - slate UI, engine modifications
- I have a good eye for spotting weak spots in the code and suggest a solution and refactor it
