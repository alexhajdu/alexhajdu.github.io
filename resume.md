## About Me

Hi, I'm Alex Hajdu — a software engineer specializing in Unreal Engine, C++, and developer tools.

I focus on advanced development and technical planning, including software architecture design, performance optimization, converting Blueprints to C++, and creating productivity tools, editor plugins, and third-party integrations.

While I understand gameplay programming and enjoy collaborating with design teams, my main focus is on C++ development and the core systems and business logic that power games and applications under the hood. I'm also passionate about R&D work and tackling the kinds of technical challenges that others often avoid.

My current work centers on mobile games and VR development, helping teams build high-performance, scalable, and maintainable projects.

I'm passionate about creating tools and systems that make developers more productive and projects more efficient. I'm easy to work with, professional, and always bring a friendly, collaborative approach to every project.
